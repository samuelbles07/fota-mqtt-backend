## Description

A backend service for managing Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware updates via MQTT written in rust. Designed as a job scheduler, it handles multiple firmware update requests simultaneously, with each job maintaining its own status. 

> This is my learning project while studying Rust. While error handling still bad, but it effectively demonstrates how OTA firmware updates happen through MQTT. It's sufficient for testing and learning purposes. In the future, I plan to improve it for use in a production environment.
